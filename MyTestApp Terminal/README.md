# Welcome

Welcome to MyTestApp Terminal, an open-source project that is an easy-to-use web-based terminal and code editor.

## Getting Started

To use MyTestApp Terminal, simply visit https://terminal.mytestapp.me/terminal in your web browser. The terminal will be available on that webpage for you to use.

Please note that it is not recommended to modify or make changes to a forked version of MyTestApp Terminal, as it may cause your changes to never be deployed on the webpage (https://terminal.mytestapp.me/terminal). The deployment process for changes made to the original repository takes some time, typically ranging from a few hours to a few days. Therefore, it's advisable to contribute to the main repository directly to ensure that your changes are incorporated and deployed on the webpage.

## Contributing

We encourage you to contribute to MyTestApp Terminal and help make it even better! You have write access to the repository, allowing you to directly modify the code without any additional steps.

Feel free to make changes to the repository to add new features, fix bugs, or improve existing functionality. Your contributions will be reviewed and considered for deployment on https://terminal.mytestapp.me/terminal.

If you encounter any issues, have questions, or want to suggest new ideas, please open an issue on the project's repository (https://github.com/MyTestAppOpen/MyTestApp-Terminal). We value your feedback and will work together to address concerns and improve the project.

We appreciate your contributions to the MyTestApp Terminal project and thank you for helping us create a better terminal and code editor experience!
